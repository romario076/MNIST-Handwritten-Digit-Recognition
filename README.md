# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Current notebook is a simple task for image recognition.
Training a classifier on the MNIST dataset is regarded as the hello world of image recognition.

MNIST data set contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.
